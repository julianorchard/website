# Hi there, I'm Julian Orchard

## Welcome to my website/blog/slice of the www...

I'm a Marketing Coordinator who brings front-end development, scripting, automation, and other technical abilities to his roles. I'm a long time [GitHub](https://github.com/julianorchard/) contributor, enjoyer of Linux, vegetarian, and dad.

I use PHP, Python, JavaScript, CSS, and HTML, as well as having skills with Visual Basic, Lua, and scripting languages like Shell, PowerShell, and AutoHotkey on Windows.

I enjoy Emacs and Vim. It's definitely possible to enjoy both (but only Emacs with Evil mode, of course...)! I might write about them, occasionally, on my [blog](/posts/).

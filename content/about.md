# About Me

![Me (on the left), circa Nov 2016, on a one year anniverary dinner.](/res/me-1.jpg)

I'm Julian and I've been working for half a decade as a Marketing Coordinator. With a passion for scripting and design, I always try and bring these talents to my work. I enjoy making simple but refined designs that are accessible to people of all walks of life.

This website is mostly going to be used to jot down thoughts about work related things. I want to share knowledge, and I want to make a habit of blogging for *myself*, as a positive routine.

If you want to get in contact with me, my email is [hello@julianorchard.co.uk](mailto:hello@julianorchard.co.uk), or I'm available on [Mastodon](https://mastodon.social/@jdo).

# About Me

![Me (on the left), circa Nov 2016, on a one year anniverary dinner.](/res/me-1.jpg)

Hi, I'm Julian and I've been working for about half a decade as a Marketing Coordinator. With a passion for scripting and design, I always try and bring these talents to my work. 

This website is mostly going to be used to jot down thoughts about work related things. I want to share knowledge, and I want to make a personal habit of blogging.

If you want to get in contact with me, my email is [hello@julianorchard.co.uk](mailto:hello@julianorchard.co.uk), or I'm available on [Mastodon](https://mastodon.social/@jdo).

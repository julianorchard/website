# Hello world!

## A pretty traditional, but nice, way to title the first post on a pretty traditional static site generator (written in bash)

This blog is powered by a tiny static site generator I've written in bash script. It's just over 100 lines long! The only features are './blog -n or --new' to create a new post, and './blog -b or --build', which is used to generate the whole site. It's therefore pretty simple.

However, I've really tried to make this super simple to use and nice looking too.

## Why?

I simply don't have much *need* to learn a fully featured static site generator such as the incredible [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) or the much beloved [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com). I just want something to be able to jot down some notes, and writing a short script to do this for me was actually the most efficient way to do this, in my opinion.

[Wordpress](https://wordpress.org/)? It's great, but it's far more hassle in terms of maintenance and would be way overkill for this use case. I also like being able to just go into the terminal, jot down some thoughts in [Vim](https://www.vim.org/) (especially with the [Goyo plugin](https://github.com/junegunn/goyo.vim)), and keep it simple.

Anyway, to see exactly how this works, visit the [repo](https://github.com/julianorchard/julianorchard.github.io) where I've written a little bit more about how it functions from a technical standpoint.

See you in the next post!

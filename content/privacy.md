# Privacy and Cookies

There's nothing here yet. This site doesn't
collect data on you at the moment. I plan on using
Google Analytics to keep track over views to
certain pages, but there's nothing at the moment.

The only way I would retain any data about you is
if you get in contact with me by email or via
Twitter, at which point that's necessary data (and
I'm not a business anyway at the end of the day).
If you're contacting me *regarding* something
business related, I won't share your info with
anyone unless I'm granted permission by you. 

This site is hosted with [GitHub
Pages](https://pages.github.com/) and you can
check I've not implemented any tracking stuff by
checking [this site's
code](https://github.com/julianorchard/julianorchard.github.io)
there too.

I *will* update this policy, if and when I get
round to implementing anything that uses cookies.

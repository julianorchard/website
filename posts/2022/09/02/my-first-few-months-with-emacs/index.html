<h1 id="my-first-few-months-with-emacs">My First Few Months With Emacs</h1>
<h2 id="from-vim-cultist-to-emacs-believer">From Vim Cultist to Emacs Believer</h2>
<p>While this experience has been more eloquently documented in other places, I thought I’d collect some thoughts here regardless. Partly because I want to write about it, and <em>partly in the hope that one person sees it who wants to try using Emacs</em>!</p>
<h3 id="background">Background</h3>
<p>I have been a massive fan of Vim, and the terminal, for a few years now. I have a nicely configured <code>.vimrc</code> file, I’ve written custom functions, and even a <a href="https://github.com/julianorchard/desc.vim">little plugin</a> to try and get to know my favourite editor a little more. But, as the description of the <a href="https://github.com/doomemacs/doomemacs">Doom Emacs</a> framework most aptly puts it;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It is a story as old as time. A stubborn, shell-dwelling, and melodramatic vimmer—envious of the features of modern text editors—spirals into despair before he succumbs to the dark side.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The ‘<em>envious of the features of modern text editors</em>’ part is what <em>really</em> inspired me to try Emacs.</p>
<p>Note: <em>I never really liked the idea of trying Doom. I really want to try and build my own config and understand it a bit more. However, I’ll probably come back to Doom when I feel like I’ve thoroughly made my own config, for other reasons.</em></p>
<h3 id="first-contact">First Contact</h3>
<p>I started by following along with the brilliant <a href="https://youtu.be/74zOY-vgkyw">Emacs From Scratch</a> YouTube series by <a href="https://systemcrafters.net/">David Wilson</a>. I was already feeling optimistic at this config file:</p>
<pre class="elisp"><code>  (setq inhibit-startup-message t)
  (scroll-bar-mode -1)
  (tool-bar-mode -1)
  (tooltip-mode -1)
  (set-fringe-mode 10)
  (menu-bar-mode -1)</code></pre>
<p>And I was almost fully invested in giving Emacs a serious go when I realised how few lines of Elisp is enough to get started with Evil Mode!</p>
<p>I had thought of Emacs as being a really far-away thing for some reason; something reserved for only those who had understanding or dedication to make it work for them. I was put off by the key-bindings, the UI, leaving the terminal, and more. But the more I started to dig into it, the more I realised it <em>is</em> what most people who use the terminal are looking for. This is when I moved from ‘making Emacs enough like vim to work for me’ to ‘wait, we don’t have that in vim…’.</p>
<h3 id="org-mode-is-great">Org Mode is great</h3>
<p>Prior to playing with Emacs, I’d heard of two ‘killer packages’: the amazing <a href="https://github.com/magit/magit">Magit</a> (git porcelain) and <a href="https://orgmode.org/">Org Mode</a>. While I think both are great, org-mode, for me, is one of the best things about using Emacs.</p>
<p><code>org-babel-tangle</code> allows you to write org-files (markdown-like documents) and tangle all the blocks of code to various files. Within a few weeks, I’d rewritten almost all of my config files, literately, and pushed them all to the <a href="https://github.com/julianorchard/config/">same repo</a>.</p>
<p>Then there’s the power of <code>org-agenda</code>. It’s great! See a list of all your upcoming tasks, let Emacs look in multiple folders for org-files to add to your todo-list. It’s hard to explain why it’s so good if you’ve not used it, but it’s such a good way of noting things down.</p>
<p>Agenda <em>really shines</em> with <code>org-capture</code>: enter a custom series of keys to capture a piece of org-text that can be templated in very complicated and useful ways. For example, I’ve been maintaining a personal <code>journal.org</code> file. I hit <code>SPC c</code> to bring up the <em>capture menu</em>, then <code>j</code> to select a journal capture. I the write a piece of org-text and upon <code>Ctrl-C Ctrl-C</code> (a very common binding in Emacs to confirm or run things) it gets inserted into the <code>journal.org</code> file under the year, month, date; like this:</p>
<pre class="org"><code>
* Year
** Month
*** Date
**** Timestamp 
     This is an entry!
</code></pre>
<p>I initially synced my collection of org documents with OneDrive, but I’ve stopped that. The beauty of them being small text files is that I can just sync them with scripts and other simple solutions. I use <a href="https://syncthing.net/">Syncthing</a> now, mainly, running on a server so I can connect it to my phone too (using <a href="https://github.com/orgzly/orgzly-android">Orgzly</a> to get notified of events and create new ones).</p>
<h3 id="thoughts-on-vim">Thoughts on Vim</h3>
<p>At the moment, I’m at a strange place with Vim.</p>
<p>There’s a famous saying about Emacs:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Emacs is a great operating system, lacking only a decent editor.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This quote has actually made me realise that whilst I love the extensibility of Vim, the core component I really love is the modal editing. It’s actually quite a relief to know that this modal editing can be so successful in editing software other than the original, such as in Emacs with Evil Mode.</p>
<p>Emacs really is a great combination for Vim users because the extensibility is there too. But it makes me less concerned about trying more VSCode and JetBrains Vim plugins in the future.</p>
<h3 id="another-similarity-of-emacsterm-stuff">Another Similarity of Emacs/Term Stuff</h3>
<p>In my first few weeks of hype around Emacs, I decided that I would be conservative about what I would and would not <em>ask</em> of Emacs. For example, managing mail (although I had previously used Neomutt) is something, I told myself, that was too much for me to bother to do with Emacs. However, as I get deeper and deeper into Emacs, I’m finding it harder to stick to said boundaries I’ve set.</p>
<p>I was initially surprised by this, but actually realised that it’s similar with vim-like things for the terminal. When I first discovered the command line, I think I set myself the ‘line’ of not using it for file management. But tools like <a href="https://github.com/ranger/ranger">Ranger</a> or <a href="https://github.com/dylanaraps/fff">fff</a> have given me pause to reconsider that line, and I’ve used them quite extensively. I think it’s just a side effect of them being so extensible.</p>
<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
<p>This post is a bit all over the place but, contrary to this, I’m feeling quite clear about where I want to go next with my Emacs journey.</p>
<p>I’m working on using Eshell and Dired a bit more, trying to get more language understanding, and trying to dive even further into Org. I will probably post a follow-up to this at some point, maybe at a year after using Emacs.</p>

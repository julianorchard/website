<h1 id="a-much-longer-journey-into-file-annotation">A Much Longer
Journey Into File Annotation</h1>
<h2 id="how-i-ended-up-writing-my-first-vim-plugin">How I ended up
writing my first Vim Plugin…</h2>
<p>In a <a
href="https://julianorchard.co.uk/posts/2022/02/09/a-short-journey-in-file-annotation/">previous
post</a>, I took a short look into how I’d gone from tagging my files
using a small shell script, and how I’d changed my method to use a Vim
<code>iabbrev</code>.</p>
<p>I thought that would be the end of my journey, but I decided to use
the opportunity to make a small Vim plugin which made the whole process
a lot more easy to configure if there’s extra functionality
required.</p>
<h2 id="the-good-the-bad-the-ugly">The Good, The Bad, &amp; The
Ugly</h2>
<p>The plugin I ended up creating has some really nice elements, some
elements I struggled with, and some problems I’m yet to solve…</p>
<h3 id="the-good">The Good</h3>
<p>I needed a way to let someone using the file input their signature
(e.g., “Julian Orchard <a href="mailto:hello@julianorchard.co.uk"
class="email">hello@julianorchard.co.uk</a>”), and I came up with a way
of doing that which works really well in my opinion.</p>
<p>Once the plugin is installed (I use <a
href="https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug">Vim-Plug</a> for regular
Vim, and with Neovim I use <a
href="https://github.com/wbthomason/packer.nvim">Packer.nvim</a>), you
can define either a string in your <code>.vimrc</code> file, or a
list.</p>
<p>For example;</p>
<pre><code>
&quot; A String
let g:desc_author = &quot;Julian Orchard &lt;hello@julianorchard.co.uk&gt;&quot;

&quot; A List
let g:desc_author = [[&quot;desc&quot;, &quot;Julian Orchard &lt;hello@julianorchard.co.uk&gt;&quot;],
                    \[&quot;des2&quot;, &quot;Another Signature &lt;me@julianorchard.co.uk&gt;&quot;]]
</code></pre>
<p>This conveniently solves the issue of how to easily define a
signature, but also makes it possible for the user of the plugin to
change the <code>iabbrev</code> <em>keyword</em> used. The list doesn’t
have to have multiple values; if you want to reclaim the word
<code>desc</code> (the default keyword), you can just do something like
this:</p>
<pre><code>
let g:desc_author = [[&quot;trigger_desc&quot;, &quot;Julian Orchard &lt;hello@julianorchard.co.uk&gt;&quot;]
</code></pre>
<p>I was really happy with this solution, but what happens if someone
doesn’t add anything to their <code>.vimrc</code> file?</p>
<p>Initially, I just removed the line from the description, if no
<code>g:desc_author</code> was defined, but I came up with a pretty nice
alternative… you can add this as an <code>iabbrev</code> to your config
files independently too, I think it’s pretty good:</p>
<pre><code>
iab &lt;expr&gt; ~g substitute(system(&#39;git config --global user.name&#39;) . &quot; &lt;&quot; . 
    \system(&#39;git config --global user.email&#39;) . &quot;&gt;&quot;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;&#39;, &#39;g&#39;)
</code></pre>
<p>This gets your <code>git config --global user.name</code> and
<code>user.email</code> variables, and uses them to create the
signature. Mine is
<code>julianorchard &lt;hello@julianorchard.co.uk&gt;</code>, for
example.</p>
<h3 id="the-bad">The Bad</h3>
<p>I think using <code>iabbrev</code> might have been a mistake, in
hindsight. I didn’t find it very flexible in how it works, and figuring
out I needed <code>&lt;expr&gt;</code> took longer than it should have;
it wasn’t very intuitive.</p>
<p>The code also repeats itself more than I’d like as a result. It’s not
too bad, but I have four different <code>iabbrev</code>’s in the final
version;</p>
<ul>
<li>One for block comments and there is a signature to add</li>
<li>One for line comments and there is a signature to add</li>
<li>One for block comments and there is no signature to add</li>
<li>One for line comments and there is no signature to add</li>
</ul>
<p>It’s just not as clean as I’d like, and I think I’d have more
flexibility using a remapped keybinding or some other feature.</p>
<h3 id="the-ugly">The Ugly</h3>
<p>I’m fairly certain the <code>autocmd</code>’s I have made use of do
not work in the most performative way. I don’t notice an impact from
them, but each time the user goes into <em>insert mode</em>, the
<code>iabbrev</code> is updated.</p>
<h2 id="perfectionist">Perfectionist</h2>
<p>Unfortunately, I am a bit of a perfectionist, and I’m not 100% happy
with the plugin, but I have to praise myself; for my first Vim plugin,
I’m pretty content with it.</p>
<p>I’ve tested it with my Neovim config, which is new for me, and it
seems to also work well.</p>
<p>That’s it.</p>
<h2 id="edit-almost-immediately-after-publishing">Edit, almost
immediately after publishing:</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>No, that’s not it! The plugin is <a
href="https://github.com/julianorchard/desc.vim">here</a> if you want to
check it out, or have any much appreciated feedback! That’s it.</p>
